# assignment5_lang_self-assigned_Emma-Marie 

## Description and purpose
Self-assigned assignment for language analytics. A classifier trained on danish sermons to predicting the gender of the priest writing the specific sermon. This prediction is a binary classification problem with the seromns either having the label 1 for male or 2 for female. 

## Data
The data used for this assignemnet is a corpus of 11,955 sermons by 95 pastors from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark. The data set contains different information about the pastors and the day the sermon was held, but for my classifier I only need the gender (1 = male, 2 = female), and the sermon content. 

__NB__ Due to GDPR rules, I haven't pushed the data set to Github. You must get the data from my teacher Ross to be able to run the script. For the code to run properly, the folder with the data must be placed outside the assignment folder. Your folder structure should looks like this:

    - work
        - 76870
            - data
                - content.dat
            - metadata  
                - Joined_Meta.xlsx
        - cds-language
            - assignment-5_lang_self-assigned_Emma-Marie

or this???? --> then change paths!!

    - work
        - 76870
            - data
                - content.dat
            - metadata  
                - Joined_Meta.xlsx
